# The Wild Tool. (Summary and Docs)
*Downtool is an open sources project developed mainly in python. Currently (November 2022) it is under development, therefore, you may encounter options that are not there or that are buggier than GTA the trilogy when it came out.*


## Summary
TheWildTool is a tool developed with the main objective of saving time when working with audio datasets. Either to prepare them (segmentation of your raw audio and more), to get them (get content from the internet like YouTube and more) or to train a model with them (train a model with your dataset created with the above and more). 

As already said, TheWildTool covers all these sections to have your space much tidier and cleaner. Only a few libraries are sometimes necessary.



## Classes Summary
- ***ProccessAudio:*** It processes the audio to obtain different types of information in order to train a model.

- ***GenerateDataSet:*** Generate extraid datasets of key sites!

- ***VideoExtract:*** Process your videos into audio.



## TheWildTool Origin
*Comming Soon...*

# Documents
## **ProccessAudio:**
 *Processes the audios and operates with them.*

--  ProccessAudio | ***type: class***


***Import:***
```python
from TheWildTool.WorkData import ProccessAudio

audiop = ProdcessAudio()
```


***Methods:***

- **...add_to_queue:**
	```python
	ProccessAudio.add_to_queue(route_files: list)
	```
	- ***route_files:*** list of audio file paths. **(.wav)**
	
	*Add your audios to the list, and then work with them.*


- **...listen:**
	```python
	ProccessAudio.listen(index: int)
	```
	- ***index:*** Index of element belonging to extract_queue.
	
	*Show audio in a notebook.*


- **...view:**
	```python
	ProccessAudio.view(index: int, grid  = False, save  = False, image_size  =  (20, 10), **kwargs)
	```
	- ***index:*** Index of element belonging to extract_queue.
	- ***grid*** (bool, optional): Activate or deactivate the grid of your chart. Defaults to False.
	- ***save*** (bool, optional): Save the graph in its save_route. Defaults to False.
	- ***image_size*** (tuple, optional): Image size (it is not presented in pixels. It is useful to download this if you don't have a good graphic). Defaults to (20, 10).
	- *****kwargs*** (optional).	


	*It generates a graph that represents the decibels of your audio over time.*

## **VideoExtract:**
 *Extract audio from video files.*

--  VideoExtract | ***type: class***


***Import:***
```python
from TheWildTool.WorkData import VideoExtract

videos = VideoExtract()
```


***Methods:***

- **...add_to_queue:**
	```python
	ProccessAudio.add_to_queue(route_files: list)
	```
	- ***route_files:*** list of audio file paths. **(.wav)**
	
	*Add your audios to the list, and then work with them.*


- **...to_audio:**
	```python
	ProccessAudio.to_audio()
	```
	*Extract the audio from the video.*
